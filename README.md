# Project Title

Restaurant Popularity and Failure Prediction

# Tool

Python 

# Data 

2017 Yelp Dataset Challenge 

# Background

Existing restaurant ranking metrics of Yelp are biased: (1) A high number of reviews doesn’t necessarily mean the restaurants are good because they can be complaints. (2) The star ratings for new restaurants are not accurate because there are too few feedbacks. 
A novel unbiased popularity metric was created by multiplying the normalized number of reviews and the normalized star-rating. 
	
# Modelling

The popularity and closure of restaurants were predicted by Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models. 
The Naïve Bayes model achieved an AUC of 0.7 for predicting popularity. The Decision Tree model achieved an AUC of 0.75 for predicting closure of the restaurants. 

# My role

Design the study and build the models.
